                  LEARNING GULP

****************************************************
                  Random Notes
****************************************************

1. In Gulp you write tasks and then you tell Gulp to
   run those tasks.
2. To install: 
   npm install -g gulp
   sudo npm install -g gulp
   
   If you want to install it for a node project you 
   most likely need: 
   sudo npm install --save-dev gulp
   
3. We will write our tasks in the file gulpfile.js

4. To run a default task all you would need to do is
   type gulp on the command line.
   
5. We can add plugins to Gulp to add functionality.
   gulpjs.com/plugins

6. npm install --save-dev gulp-uglify
   gulp-uglify is to minify javascript.
   
7. We can give the default gulp task an array in order
   to run multiple tasks.
